# Reversi Basic
## Project description

The aim of this project was to create a basic version of Reversi.

The group was restricted to using Java and JavaFX for the project. So choosing what languages 
would be relevant for the given problem wasn't a part of it.

## How to install and run the project
The project is made in Java 19. this is therefore the recommended version for using the project.
To run the jar file for the project, opening command prompt in the same folder as the file and 
typing "java -jar BasicReversi.jar" will do so.

Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the program is optimized for use on a monitor with a 2k- or
1080p resolution with applications size at 100%. 

## How to use the project
When opening the project, the user goes directly into a game of Reversi. Once the game is played to end,
the user will be taken to a "restart" page were the user can choose do start over. This cycle repeats till
the application is closed.
